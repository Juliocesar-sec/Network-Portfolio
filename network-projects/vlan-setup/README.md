#  VLAN Setup Lab

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the configuration and implementation of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) using Cisco networking devices in a simulated environment.

The purpose of this lab is to improve network organization, security, and traffic management by separating departments into different VLANs.

**Objectives**

- Create and configure VLANs
- Assign switch ports to VLANs
- Configure trunk ports
- Test VLAN communication
- Improve network segmentation
- Practice basic switch administration


**Network Structure**

The lab environment includes:

- 1 Cisco Switch
- Multiple PCs
- VLAN segmentation by department
- Trunk configuration for VLAN traffic

#  Configuration Tasks

**VLAN Creation**
- Created VLAN 10
- Created VLAN 20
- Created VLAN 30

**Port Assignment**

- Assigned switch ports to specific VLANs
- Configured access ports

**Trunk Configuration**

- Enabled trunking between switches
- Allowed VLAN traffic across trunk links

#  Testing Performed

The following tests were completed:

- VLAN verification
- Device communication within VLANs
- VLAN isolation testing
- Trunk port validation
- IP connectivity testing

---

#  Benefits of VLANs

- Improved network organization
- Reduced broadcast traffic
- Better security separation
- Easier network management
- Department segmentation

---

#  Skills Demonstrated
