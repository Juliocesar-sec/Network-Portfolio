# pfSense – Practical Guide

📌 **What is pfSense?**

pfSense is an open-source firewall and routing platform built on top of FreeBSD. It is designed to provide enterprise-grade network security, routing, and traffic control in a flexible and customizable way.

Unlike simple host-based firewalls, pfSense operates at the network perimeter, managing traffic between internal networks and external connections with advanced filtering and monitoring capabilities. 

**What pfSense is used for**

pfSense is commonly deployed in home labs, small businesses, and enterprise environments to centralize network security and control.

It is used for:

* Protecting internal networks from external threats
* Controlling inbound and outbound network traffic
* Creating and managing VPN connections for secure remote access
* Monitoring network activity and generating traffic logs
* Segmenting networks using VLANs and firewall rules
* Acting as a gateway between multiple networks or internet connections

**Where pfSense can run**

pfSense is flexible and can be installed on different types of hardware depending on performance needs:

* Physical servers (dedicated firewall machines)
* Virtual machines (VMs) in environments like Proxmox, VMware, or VirtualBox
* Dedicated firewall appliances designed for network infrastructure

**Why pfSense is widely used**

pfSense is popular because it combines powerful networking features with a web-based interface that simplifies configuration. Instead of manually managing low-level firewall rules, administrators can configure routing, NAT, VPNs, and security policies through a centralized dashboard.

It is often used as a full network edge solution, replacing traditional commercial firewalls in many scenarios while still providing advanced control and visibility over traffic flow.

 **Why Use pfSense?**
 
pfSense is widely adopted because it combines enterprise-level networking capabilities with a relatively simple interface, making advanced firewall and routing features accessible without requiring deep manual configuration of system-level tools.

**Advanced enterprise-grade firewall**

pfSense provides a powerful stateful firewall engine capable of handling complex rule sets, multiple interfaces, VLAN segmentation, and high-throughput environments. It is suitable for both small networks and enterprise deployments.

**User-friendly web interface**

Instead of relying only on command-line configuration, pfSense offers a centralized web-based dashboard. This makes it easier to manage firewall rules, routing, VPNs, and network interfaces in a structured and visual way.

**Excellent VPN support**

pfSense includes built-in support for multiple VPN technologies, including:

* OpenVPN
* IPsec
* WireGuard

This allows secure remote access, site-to-site connections, and encrypted communication between networks.

**Real-time monitoring**

The system provides live visibility into network traffic, bandwidth usage, active connections, and system performance. This helps administrators quickly identify issues, detect unusual activity, and understand network behavior.

**Package system (extensibility)**

pfSense can be extended with additional packages to enhance security and functionality, such as:

* Snort (intrusion detection/prevention)
* Squid (proxy caching and filtering)
* pfBlockerNG (DNS and IP-based blocking)

These tools allow pfSense to function not only as a firewall, but as a full-featured network security platform.

Overall, pfSense is used because it bridges the gap between powerful networking control and practical usability, making it a strong choice for both learning environments and production networks.

## Basic Concepts

Understanding pfSense starts with how it separates and controls network traffic through interfaces and firewall rules. The system is built around the idea that each network segment must be explicitly defined and controlled.

**Interfaces**

Interfaces in pfSense represent different network connections. Each interface can have its own IP range, rules, and security policies.

- **WAN** → Internet connection
- 
  The WAN interface is the connection to the external network, usually the internet.

* Handles inbound and outbound internet traffic
* Typically the most exposed interface
* Protected by strict firewall rules by default

- **LAN** → Internal network
- 
The LAN interface represents the internal private network.

* Used by internal devices (PCs, servers, printers)
* Usually trusted by default
* Allows controlled access to external networks through WAN

- **OPT** → Optional interfaces (DMZ, VLANs, guest networks, etc.)

 OPT interfaces are additional configurable network ports used for segmentation.

They can be configured as:

* DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
* VLANs (Virtual LANs)
* Guest networks
* IoT or isolated device networks

These interfaces help separate traffic and improve security by isolating different network zones.

**Firewall Rules**  

In pfSense, firewall rules are applied directly per interface, meaning each network segment can have its own access policies.

Rules define what traffic is allowed or blocked based on direction, source, destination, and protocol.

👉 Common examples:

- Allow LAN → Internet
→ Internal devices are allowed to access external services (web browsing, updates, APIs)

- Block WAN → LAN (default behavior)  
→ External traffic is blocked from directly accessing internal devices unless explicitly allowed

** NAT (Network Address Translation)**  
Allows multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address.

**Stateful Firewall**  

- Tracks the state of connections  
- Automatically allows legitimate return traffic  

**VPN**  

- Secure remote access  
- Site-to-site connections between offices  

 **IDS/IPS (via packages)**  
 
- Detects attacks  
- Blocks intrusions  

 **Monitoring**  
 
- Detailed logs  
- Real-time traffic graphs  
- Connection statistics and alerts  

 **Installation (Quick Summary)**

1. Download the ISO from the official website  
2. Install on a physical machine or virtual machine  
3. Configure interfaces (WAN/LAN)  
4. Access the web interface:

```
https://192.168.1.1
```

 **Recommended Initial Setup**

1. Change the default password  
   - Default user: **admin**  

2. Configure DNS  
   - Use trusted DNS servers (e.g., Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 or Google 8.8.8.8)  

3. Update the system  
   - Always keep pfSense up to date

🛡️ **Basic Security Rules**

🔸 **Block everything from WAN** (Default rule – very important)  
🔸 **Allow LAN → Internet** (So internal users can browse normally)  
🔸 **Port Forwarding** (Open specific ports)  
   Example: Expose an internal web server  
   - WAN port 80 → Internal server IP  

🌐 **Security Based on Critical Ports**

🔸 **DNS (53)**  
   - Allow only to trusted DNS servers  
   - Avoid open resolvers  

🔸 **SSH (22)**  
   - Restrict by IP or  
   - Prefer using VPN instead of direct exposure  

🔸 **Telnet (23)**  
   - ❌ **Block completely**  

🔸 **SMB (445)**  
   - ❌ **Never expose on WAN**  

🔸 **Databases (3306, 5432, etc.)**  
   - ❌ Only allow from internal network or VPN  

🔸 **UPnP (1900/udp)**  
   - ⚠️ Disable whenever possible  

📁 **Advanced Features**

🔹 **VLANs**  
   - Network segmentation (e.g., IT, Guests, IoT)  

🔹 **Captive Portal**  
   - Login page for public Wi-Fi  

🔹 **Traffic Shaping (QoS)**  
   - Bandwidth control and prioritization  

🔹 **High Availability (HA)**  
   - Failover between two pfSense devices
   - 

 **Useful Packages**

- **Snort / Suricata** → IDS/IPS  
- **pfBlockerNG** → IP blocking and ad blocking  
- **Squid** → Web proxy and caching  
- **OpenVPN / WireGuard** → VPN solutions  

 **Monitoring and Logs**

- Firewall logs  
- Traffic graphs per interface  
- Active connections  
- System alerts  

⚠️ **Important Warnings**

- ❗ A wrong configuration can take down your entire network  
- ❗ Exposing ports incorrectly is extremely risky  
- ❗ Always make backups of your configuration  

 **Best Practices**

 Running pfSense effectively is not just about configuring rules, but about maintaining a secure and controlled network posture over time. Good firewall design follows consistent principles that reduce exposure and simplify troubleshooting.

- 🔒 Principle of least privilege

 Only allow the minimum level of access required for systems and users to function.

* Avoid broad “allow any” rules
* Restrict traffic by source, destination, and service
* Limit administrative access to trusted hosts only

This reduces the attack surface and prevents unnecessary exposure of services.

- 🌐 Use VPN for remote access
- 
Remote administration should never rely on direct exposure of internal services.

* Use VPN solutions like OpenVPN, IPsec, or WireGuard
* Require authentication before network access is granted
* Encrypt all remote traffic between users and the network

This ensures secure access without opening internal systems to the public internet.

- 🚫 Minimize open ports
- 
Every open port represents a potential entry point.

* Close unused services and interfaces
* Only expose required services to external networks
* Regularly audit firewall rules to remove unnecessary exceptions

A smaller attack surface means fewer opportunities for exploitation.
  
- 📊 Monitor logs constantly
  
Logging provides visibility into network activity and potential threats.

* Review firewall logs for blocked and allowed traffic
* Identify unusual patterns or repeated connection attempts
* Use logs for troubleshooting and incident detection

Consistent monitoring helps detect issues before they escalate.
  
- 🔄 Keep the system updated regularly
- 
Security updates are essential for maintaining system integrity.

* Apply pfSense updates as they are released
* Patch underlying FreeBSD components when required
* Update installed packages and plugins

Unpatched systems are one of the most common causes of firewall compromise.
